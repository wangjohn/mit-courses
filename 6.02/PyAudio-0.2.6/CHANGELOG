  PyAudio 0.2.6

  - Added support for Python 3.  As of this update, PyAudio is
    compatible with Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.2.

    Many thanks to Bastian Bechtold and Bob Jamison for their patches!

  - Fixed a bug in which a list could be modified during iteration.

    Many thanks to Danilo J. S. Bellini for reporting this error!

  - Fixed a memory bug involving Mac OS X channel maps.

  PyAudio 0.2.5

  - Added support for callback (non-blocking) operation.

    Many thanks to Bastian Bechtold for his initial contribution and
    his generous help towards releasing this feature.  Callback mode
    would not have happened without Bastian's help!

  PyAudio 0.2.4

  - Maintenance release: updated directory structure and packaging.

  PyAudio 0.2.3

  - Release the GIL during blocking PortAudio I/O calls.

  - Fixed Python argument parsing to use a long for PaSampleFormat
    (rather than int).

    Thanks to many who have pointed out these two issues and sent
    patches.

  - pyaudio.PyAudio.is_format_supported() now throws a ValueError
    exception if the specified format is not supported for any reason
    (or returns True if the format is supported).

    Prior, the method would return False if and only if the specified
    sample rate was unsupported. is_format_supported() now will always
    return True or throw an exception.
